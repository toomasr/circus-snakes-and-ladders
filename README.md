Circus
======

Circus is like Snakes and Ladders. You have a dice that you roll
and then move your meeple/button the number of tiles that the
dice shows you. Your mission is to your meeple to the last tile
but some circus animals and/or attractions help you get ahead
or fall behind.

As I was playing this with my children I thought how long
can this possibly go on (father of the year!) and I took
a photo of the gameboard and wrote some Python later on.

Using the Repository
=======================

Run `circus.py` that will output the number of moves per
game. It will print 1M lines by default.

If you pipe this to `output.csv` then this is the default
filename that the `analyse.pynb` uses to run the stats.
